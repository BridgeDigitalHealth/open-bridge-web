        "summary": "The Walk and Balance assessment is a multi-part activity measuring gait disturbance and motor function similar to a number of traditional assessments: the 25 ft walk, gait analysis, and a stand test.  Walk and Balance consists of two sub-assessments: (1) the participant walks for 30 seconds with their phone in their pocket, and (2) the participant turns around 360o then stands still for 30 seconds. Data collected from this assessment includes x,y,z accelerometer readings (at ~100Hz) and rotation rates from the gyroscope.",
